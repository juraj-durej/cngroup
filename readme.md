Problem: Calculator


Write code to calculate a result from a set of instructions. Instructions consist in a keyword
and a number that are separated by a space per line. Instructions are loaded from file and results
are output to the screen. Any number of Instructions can be specified. Instructions can be any
binary operators of your choice (e.g., add, divide, subtract, multiply etc). The instructions will
ignore mathematical precedence. The last instruction should be “apply” and a number (e.g.,
“apply 3”). The calculator is then initialised with that number and the previous instructions
are applied to that number.
